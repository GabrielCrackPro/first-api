At night, he hacks social media, personal information, and bank records, including those of his co-workers, therapist, and a drug dealer. Elliot stops a DDoS attack against Allsafe's biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to destroy malware he finds hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety, contacts Elliot on the subway. Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete all debt records held by E Corp. He is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety, Elliot provides the FBI with an encrypted file falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's own chief technology officer (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack."

A police officer, Dominique, attempts to arrest Elliot after she discovers the alternate Elliot's body. Elliot escapes to Coney Island, where he discovers that there was no wedding. Mr. Robot explains to Elliot that the world they are in is not the parallel world Whiterose spoke of, but rather an illusion created by Elliot with the intention of keeping 'the real Elliot' trapped. Bewildered and confused, Elliot wakes up in Krista's office. Krista (who is a manifestation of Elliot's mind at this point) explains that the Elliot we have known since the beginning of the series is not the real Elliot, but a persona called 'The Mastermind' that the real Elliot created to deal with his rage and anger at the world. However, this persona decided to take over and trapped the real Elliot in the Utopian world, getting rid of Darlene, who is the real Elliot's strongest connection to reality; Krista explains that the Mastermind must give control back to the real Elliot, but he refuses as the world collapses. The Mastermind wakes up in the hospital, where Darlene reveals that Whiterose is dead, her machine was destroyed, and she knew that the Mastermind had taken over. Accepting his identity, the Mastermind returns to Elliot's mind with the rest of his personas. The real Elliot wakes up in the hospital and is greeted by Darlene."
